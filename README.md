## AI disclosure for Improved Transparency v0.1

The system allows for selection of standardised AI usage cases and based on the inputs provided, it generates
a standardised disclosure statement that can be copy-pasted into the relevant section of a paper.

To use the tools: select whether AI was not used (**section 1A** - to generate a default negative statement) or
specify the AI model(s) used in **section 1B**. You can select the number of model used - for each AI system you will be
able to provide its name, version and (optionally) the usage date (useful as timestamp in cases when versioning for
a particular AI model is not available).
  
For each model you will be able to select a number of usage categories, grouped into three main areas: content generation,
content refinement and content comparisons. Usage categories include: conceptualisation, data curation,
formal analysis, funding acquisition, investigation, methods, visualisation, validation and writing.
  
In **section 2** you can provide additional information about your AI usage, including whether you have supervised the
AI outputs, whether your use of AI formally complies with ethical guidelines of an institution or funding body,
and whether you have archived the prompts used. You can also provide any other comments that will be added verbatim.
  
Once you have provided all the relevant information, click the *'Generate text'* button to produce the disclosure statement,
which will appear in the left-hand panel. You can then copy it to clipboard, or download it as XML for later use.
The XML file serves as a reproducible record of your AI usage disclosure and can be re-uploaded to restore the form state
in case you need to regenerate or modify the disclosure statement at a later time. At any point you clik the *'Clear
all inputs'* button to reset the form.
